# OnlyVibes Frontend 🪩

OnlyVibes is a social event discovery platform designed to help users find, create, and review local events. This repository contains the **React Frontend** application, serving as the client-side interface for the OnlyVibes ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features & Capabilities

### 1. User Authentication & Profile Management
* **Secure Auth Flow:** Complete Sign-up and Login implementation using JWT tokens stored in LocalStorage.
* **Guest Mode:** Non-authenticated users can browse events but are prompted to sign in for interactive features (reviews, creating events).
* **Profile Dashboard:** Users can view their stats (followers/following), access organized events, and manage preferences.

### 2. Event Management (CRUD)
* **Browse:** Scrollable feed of events with "Optimistic UI" updates for liking/unliking to ensure responsiveness.
* **Create:** Comprehensive form for creating new events (Title, Description, Category, Date/Time).
* **Edit:** functionality to update event details for event organizers.
* **Delete:** Ownership verification ensures only the event creator can delete an event.

### 3. Social & Review System
* **Interactive Reviews:** Users can leave star ratings and comments on events.
* **Review Management:** Users can edit or delete their own reviews directly from the event details page.
* **Likes:** Heart system to save events to a "Liked" list.

### 4. Advanced UI/UX
* **Mobile-First Design:** Implements a bottom navigation bar and touch-friendly cards tailored for mobile viewports.
* **Feedback Systems:** Custom `PopupDialog` components replace standard browser alerts for a cohesive design language (Confirmations, Success, Errors).
* **Visual Polish:** Dark mode aesthetic using Lucide React icons and glassmorphism effects.

| **General-02** | **Mock Data Handling** | ✅ **Done** | The system handles real API data but includes robust fallbacks and mock placeholders (e.g., `mockData.js`) where backend data might be sparse during dev. |
| **General-03** | **Separation of Concerns** | ✅ **Done** | Strict separation between `api/` services, `pages/` logic, and reusable `components/`. |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance (Deliverable 2)

To ensure system reliability and maintainability, we have implemented a robust End-to-End (E2E) testing strategy using **Cypress**. This setup simulates real user behavior to validate critical workflows before any code reaches production.

### 1. E2E Test Coverage (Frontend)
We have developed automated tests covering **3 distinct User Flows** that span across all core application screens (Login, Home, Event Details, Profile).

| Flow Category | Test Suite | Scenarios Covered (Happy & Unhappy Paths) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | `login.cy.js` | • **Happy:** Successful Login, Sign Up, and Account Deletion.<br>• **Unhappy:** Empty credentials submission, Duplicate email registration handling.<br>• **UI:** Modal validation errors and redirection logic. |
| **Event Lifecycle** | `events.cy.js` | • **Happy:** Create Event (with form fill), View Event Details, Delete Event.<br>• **Unhappy:** Creation attempts with missing Title or Description.<br>• **Guest:** Verification that unauthenticated users cannot access "Create" features. |
| **Review Lifecycle** | `review.cy.js` | • **Happy:** Posting a review with a star rating, canceling deletion, successful deletion.<br>• **Unhappy:** Attempting to submit a review without a star rating (Validation check). |

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
We have established a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automate quality checks and deployment.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** On every push to the `main` branch, the pipeline spins up a virtual Ubuntu environment, installs dependencies, starts the local server (`npm start`), and executes the full Cypress test suite.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** The deployment to **Render** is strictly conditional. The deploy hook is only triggered if **all** Cypress tests pass successfully, ensuring that broken code never reaches the live production environment.
